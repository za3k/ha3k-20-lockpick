This is a re-creation of the lock-picking minigame from the 1989 game [Hillsfar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsfar) by SSR. Hillsfar was chock full of minigames, and had wildly different gameplay than most SSR "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" games, which tended to focus on dungeon crawling instead. Please buy the real game, which is still for sale on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904525/Hillsfar/) and [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/forgotten_realms_the_archives_collection_two).

Lockpicks and images were extracted from screenshots of the running game.
